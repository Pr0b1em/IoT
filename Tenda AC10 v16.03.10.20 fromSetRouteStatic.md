## Vulnerability details

The Tenda AC10 v4.0 V16.03.10.20 firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function. The `dest` variable receives the `list` parameter from a POST request and is later assigned to function `save_staticroute_data`.

In the `save_staticroute_data` function, the `a2` (the value of `list`) is passed to `v5` and formatted by the `sscanf` function and in the form of `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s`. This greedy matching mechanism is not secure, as long as the size of the data we enter is larger than the size of `v13, v14, v15, v16`, it will cause a stack overflow.

The user-provided `list` can trigger this security vulnerability.
